And finally, here's the site description:

## The PixelPortal site is a forum for video game fans.

It is divided into 3 categories:

1. The first category is the general video game forum, where fans can discuss the world of certain games and exchange tips and advice.

2. The second category is for fans of old consoles and games. It's a place for exchanging good deals, so that people who take part can find good opportunities.

3. Finally, the last category is dedicated to the console wars, where we debate the best machines and the evolution of hardware.

_I hope you enjoy my site as much as I enjoyed coding it._
